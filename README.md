The group meeting was conducted on Friday, 16 February 2018, at Goldsmiths College Library from 10am to 12pm. All members were present. The following preliminary plan and timetable was agreed on. As far as possible, the group will keep to this timetable and work on the roles and responsibilties assigned. Group members picked their own responsibilities which were apportioned based on individual interests, areas of expertise, and workload balance.


### Time Frame: 
5 weeks to build and deploy (present â€“ 20 March 2018)

### Concept:
Space rescue and excavation mission

### Artwork Style:
Low polygon

### Character:
Spaceship (first-person) + Mech (third-person) + Monsters (AI third-person) + Miners (NPC third-person)

### Story:
bjective is to free miners, lure monsters, and avoid being destroyed. Miners stuck on a planet with mineral-eating monsters. Our job is to deploy from a spaceship as a mech, drill and find the miners before the monsters eat them. Most materials can be drilled through at varying speeds but some materials are incredibly hard and the mech must lure the monsters in to destroy the material without being eaten. |
